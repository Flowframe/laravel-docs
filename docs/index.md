This is a Laravel package to self host documentation for your (open-source) projects hosted on GitHub.

What's included:

-   Starter views
-   GitHub integration
-   List of all your documented repositories
-   Events which you can hook into

## How does it work

When you make changes to a project, GitHub will tell the package to update the docs via a webhook. Once sent, your site (where the docs is hosted) will be updated.

## Why?

Having a site for your documentation is more user friendly and will be easier for Google to index. You'll also have more freedom in terms of design, layout, tracking and advertisements. TL;DR: more control.
